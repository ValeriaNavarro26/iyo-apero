title: "Dynamics Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Macroeconomic Volatility"
subtitle: "Draft"
excerpt: "This document studies the impact of monetary policy on the volatility of main macroeconomics variables of Peru, Chile, Brasil and Mexico. The empirical approach used is based vector autoregressive (VAR) model extended along two dimensions. First, the model allows for stochastic volatility thus capturing the variation over time in the size of monetary policy shocks. Second, the model admits a dynamic interaction, through a transition equation, between the level of the variables in the VAR and time-varying volatility of the shocks over time."
